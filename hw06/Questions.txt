1.) National Instruments
2.) PREEMT_RT makes linux into a real-time system. 
3.) Mixed criticality is when tasks have distinct criticality levels. 
4.) The driver may schedule non-real time events before real time ones. The driver stacks are shared between tasks in PREEMT_RT.
5.) Delta. It is the time it takes from the event to occur until the relevant real time task executes.
6.) Cyclictest tests take a timestamp at a beginning time, sleeps, and then takes another time stamp. The goal is to measure the differnce between the intented delta time and the actual delta time. 
7.) A histogram of the cyclictest between preemt and preemt_rt. 
8.) Dispatch latency is the amount of time it takes for a system to respond to a request to begin operation. Scheduling latency is the time it takes for the scheduler being made aware of a task to the CPU actually running the task.
9.) The mainline model has long running interrupts that are executed in hardIRQ context. The non-critical interrupts need to finish which creates dispatch latencies.
10.) The low priority interrupt needs to finish executing before the external event can begin.
11.) IRQ threads are forced which means that there are little shims of code that are executed in the preempt threads.
