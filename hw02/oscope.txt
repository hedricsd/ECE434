1.) What's the min and max voltage?
    min = -60mV / max = 3.5V

2.) What period and frequency is it?
    period = 240.5ms / freq = 4.15Hz

3.) How close is it to 100ms?
    121.5ms

4.) Why do they differ?
    The code of togglegpio does some lines of code and then sleeps for .1 seconds. The other stuff accounts for the added extra time.

5.) Run htop and see how much processor you are using.
    about 3.3% CPU

6.) Try different values for the sleep time (2nd argument). What's the shortest period you can get? Make a table of the fastest values you try and the corresponding period and processor usage.
    sleep time/CPU usage/period
    .1s/3.3%/.2405s
    .05s/5.8%/.14s
    .01s/13.0%/.06s
    .000001/18.5%/.04

7.) How stable is the period?
    The period is stable at 2xsleep time + .04s

8.) Try launching something like vi. how stable is the period?
    When I launched vi, the period did not change

9.) Try cleaning up togglegpio.sh and removing unneeded lines. Does it impact the period?
    Yes. My period when sleep time was .1 was 219.0ms (21.5ms faster)
    
10.) togglegpio uses bash (first line in file). Try using sh. Is the period shorter?
    Period is shorter

11.) What's the shortest period you can get?
    14.5 ms
