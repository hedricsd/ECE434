- Accelerometer

## Project
I added a project idea to the EBC page. I also created a Projects.txt file that go a little in depth with my project idea.

## Make
The make file I created as well as app.c are in the make folder

## Installing Kernel Source
I installed the kernel 5.15.0-rc6-bone5 and was able to ssh into it.

## Kernel
I was able to get hello, ebbchar, and led working in ~/exploringBB/extras/kernel. For the gpio_ test, I created my own folder in hw05 titled gpio_test. In this folder I modified gpio _test to take two buttons and output to two LEDs.

## Accelerometer
I have not gotten to this part of hw05 yet.
