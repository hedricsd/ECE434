The project that I am interested in doing is a automated game board. We are going to start with an 
automated Tik-Tok-Toe board that takes an input of a square and uses a magnetic stepper motor to move
a magnetic piece to the desired place on the board. If that goes well and we have the time, we want 
to move onto an automated chess game. The biggest worry we have with this one is physical size to get
the complete chess board.
